**Challenge: Create 3 Views, Customer, Supervisor, Manager**

**1: For the Customer View**

Create a MySQL Database called bamazon, reate a Table inside of that database called products.
The products table should have each of the following columns:
**Schema:**
item_id (unique id for each product)
product_name (Name of product)
department_name
price (cost to customer)
stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

Populate this database with around 10 different products. Create a Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. This application will check if your store has enough of the product to meet the customer's request.
